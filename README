CRYPTOFOLDER
============

Cryptofolder watches a folder and encrypts its contents into another folder. 
All the files that have been added to the watched folder are removed after the
program stops so only the encrypted files remain.

Note: This program needs the openssl binary to work

Usage:

ruby cryptofolder.rb ENCRYPTED_FOLDER DECRYPTED_FOLDER

You can stop the program using the CTRL+C shortcut
