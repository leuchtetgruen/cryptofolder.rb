This folder has been encrypted using CryptoFolder.rb
(https://github.com/leuchtetgruen/cryptofolder.rb)

If you can't get the software used for encrypting these files running you
can decrypt them by hand.

You can use the openssl command to decrypt any file in this folder:

openssl aes-256-cbc -d -in ENCRYPTED_FILE -out DECRYPTED_FILE -pass pass:PASSWORD

The ENCRYPTED_FILE would be a file from this folder.
The DECRYPTED_FILE would be the filename you would like the decrypted file to have
The PASSWORD is the password you used for encryption.

If you're looking for a specific file you can first decrypt the index-file.
It's JSON-File showing you which encrypted file name belongs to which original filename

You can get the openssl program from here: https://www.openssl.org/ but it's
very likely that there is a build for your platform too.
